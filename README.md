# space-vacation

This is our first group project for the coding bootcamp class and it includes:
2 API's
AJAX to pull data
New Library /technology we have not discussed - Anime.js
We created a polished front end/UI
Met coding standards such as syntax, indentation, and comments for fellow developers
We incorporated the "What to bring" as a dynamic list which is a repeating element
We used Bootstrap as our CSS framework
The page is deployed to GitHub pages

## How to use the page:

* The page will open with all planets and rockets of choice
* User will have the option to select which planet they want to go to and which rocket they want to travel in
* User will be able to learn fun facts about the planet they travel to, including distance in miles and estimated arrival date
* User would also also learn about what they would wear and how to be prepared for their space vacation
* User will be able to return to the main screen and select another destination and rocket

## Have fun on the page and use for educational purposes or just for your own curiosity!
